# About SVGartiste

With [svgärtistë](https://joooons.github.io/svgartiste) I hoped to make a tool for creating SVG elements to copy directly into my code.

## features

- Press tab to move to the next parameter, and shift + tab to move back. The focus remains on the parameter even when the mouse clicks on the display panel.
- While the focus is on the type parameter, press `l`, `r`, or `c` to select `line`, `rectangle`, or `circle`, respectively. At the momene,t svgartiste can only handle `line`, `rectangle`, and `circle`.
- While the focus is on a coordinate or length parameter, click on the display window to change the value.
- While the focus is on a coordinate or length parameter, press up or down to adjust the value.
- Click on the `+` to add the svg element.
- Click on the `x` to remove the svg element.
- After an svg element has been appended, you can click and drag the element to a position of your liking to change the order of the svg elements.
