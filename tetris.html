                    <h3>About this version of Tetris</h3>
                    <p>This is the first personal project I worked on after the 'hello world' initiation into the world of javascript. I intentionally made this with <b>vanilla javascript</b> as a way to get acquainted with the basics. Since the tetris pieces are made of &lt;div&gt; elements, the script makes heavy use of DOM element manipulation. The data for the pieces were organized into objects made from Class constructors. A little bit of <b>SVG</b> was used for the instruction window that shows what keys to press. The title uses a simple <b>CSS animation</b>.</p>
                    <p>I fully acknowledge that there are bugs in this program. I decided to let the bugs live because I had to move on to other projects. Thank you for being understanding. :)</p>
                    <p>Some other features in this game:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A shadow lets the player know where the piece will fall.</li>
                        <li>Upon making contact with a horizontal surface, a countdown gives the player a chance to shift the position. If movement is detected, the countdown is reset. But there is an absolute time limit beyond which the piece can no longer be repositioned. Pressing down again after making contact with the surface will bypass the countdown.</li>
                        <li>When a piece is too close to the wall to rotate, some pieces will shift over one square to make room for the rotation.</li>
                        <li>Simultaneously clearing multiple rows multiplies the score earned by a set number. The best way to earn a higher score is to clear four rows at a time.</li>
                        <li>The speed of natural descent of the tetris piece increases every time a line is cleared. Note: the speed displayed on the dashboard is not entirely accurate. The speed calculation does not account for other functions interfering with the processing speed of the drop function.</li>
                        <li>Some user input features used during testing and development were left intact. For example, pressing <b>N</b> abandons the current piece and loads the next piece in the queue. <b>F</b> stops the natural descent of the tetris piece. <b>A</b> and <b>S</b> rotate the pieces counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively. <b>T</b> terminates the game. Clicking anywhere on the board creates a single floating block on that location.</li>
                    </ul>
